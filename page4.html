        <p>Short term, I to maintain good grades and get enough credits and clout to make my college resume look impressive. By short term,
            I mean throughout highschool.
            </p>
        <p>A bit further into the future, I'm going to try to get a CS major in college. I see myself going to UVA as the most likely
            outcome, but who knows where I'll be.
        </p>
        <p>Somewhere along the line I'll need to be looking for a CS internship. Probably relating to BIT stuff? Maybe a Web Dev gig?</p>

        <p>Once I'm out of college, I'll ideally have a CS job lined up in a timely manner. My dream job is still as a Game Dev as of now,
            but that's likely to change. I'll most likely take whatever coding job I can get, as long as I know I can handle the workload.
            <br><br>
            Ideally, I'll have a good chunk of free time to unwind and relax at the end of the day. That probably won't be the case with a
            CS job, but one can dream.
        </p>
        <p>Really long term, I want to be able to look back on my life and say "Yeah, if I were given the opportunity, I'd live my life over
            again. Maybe I could've done better at times, but I at least put in the effort."
