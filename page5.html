        <div class="row">
            <p class="column" style="align-self: center;">What motivates me is fun. The first thing that registers in my mind when I do something is,
                "do I <strong><em>want</em></strong> to do this?" <br>
                Of course, someties I'm willing to put in the effort to do things that aren't fun. But even so, even if I do that, my mind always
                wanders to "I could be doing something fun, instead of doing this."
            </p>
            <div class="column">
                <img src="lol.jpg" alt="A dumb meme :D" style="width: 50%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <div style="background-image: url(alsoworkig.jpg);" class="fixed"></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Usually, the best way to motivate me through something that isn't fun is to make something <em>else</em> I can do at the same
            time fun. For example, as I'm writing this, I have Discord open. Why? Well, it motivates me. As long as it's there, I can be
            confident that my friends are right there for me to talk to, if I want. <br>
            Although, to be fair, I don't instigate conversation while I'm working. If someone pings me, I know it's important and that I 
            can take a break and respond to it. After some back and forth banter, my brain has had the break it deserves, and back to work
            it goes.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Even so, breaks are only one part of it. If I can, I can make the workload easier by having fun doing it. I'm basically talking
            to myself here, slinging jokes at myself, being an absolute goofball via this text on the screen. I can make my work that much
            less of a dredge by doing that. <br>
            This is actually a tactic I employed in science. Of course, lab reports have to be professional, I don't mess around with that.
            (Usually.) But whenever I get an opportunity to be casual, I go wild. Makes the work less strenuous, even fun, at times.
        </p>

        <p>
            When that's not an option, logic takes the wheel. What will doing this do for me? Is it worth the work? <br>
            In schoolwork, the answer is basically always "yes." The exception is extra credit that I don't need, or that I don't do because
            I feel my existing grade is high enough, I'll be able to maintain it, yadda yadda yadda I don't feel the extra safety net is
            necessary. <br> 
            While this motivates me, it always makes working an absolute dread. So yeah, I don't really prefer this method.
