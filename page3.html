            <p>Yeah okay, it's still cliche. But it's fun! I get to effectively write stories willy nilly, and the fact that
                other people can contribute to it makes it so that even <em>I</em> have no idea what'll happen next, which makes it
                that much more fun! I find it's a great way to flex my creativity muscles. (If that analogy makes any sense whatsoever.)

            <p style="text-align: left; margin: 20px 2% 0px 20px" class="column">What I REALLY love about this game is the combat. It's unique among
                other games due to the fast paced action. A near perfect model of what I like to call "Macro duels." The best part
                is that certain projectiles, once you launch them, are controllable, which makes the combat <strong>THAT</strong> much
                more engaging. It really adds another layer of depth to the whole system. <br>
                And the community is great too! It's filled with devoted ATLA fans, with specific interests across the spectrum.
                Lore enthusiasts, trivia enthusiasts, theory enthusiasts, the whole shebang. A great game to play, really.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left; margin: 20px 20px 0px 2%" class="column">An amazing open world game with all sorts of fun adventures just
                waiting to happen. The combat is decent; the best part about it is the unique spell creation system that allows for countless
                unique attacks to be created out of a few simple options. The open world, though, is by far the BEST part about it. <br>
                There are NPCs all over the place; hidden in secluded woods, milling around towns, hanging out in randomly placed camps, etc.
                There are random landmarks all over the place, with chests hidden across the world as well. Even though there is a map, just
                walking randomly across the game you're sure to have a unique adventure every time. It's even better with friends. <br>
                With a good group of friends, you can have the greatest time of your life. Just chilling at the ocean fishing, decimating
                hordes of dark wizards for fun, running from the Magic Council (basically cops) after destroying a building, the possibilities
                are endless. In my words, situations like these "are the definition of <strong>V I B E</strong>"

        <div class="row">
            <p style="text-align: left; margin: 20px 5% 0px 20px" class="column">Like World of Magic, it has a cool open world with goodies hidden all
                over the place. But that's not what makes it fun. The best part about it is the tests of skill. <br>
                Sure, discovering new stuff is fun when you decide to go on a tangent. But if you decide to go on a combo run, that's where
                I find the game to be the best. <br>
                In the game, you get combo points for doing tricks. You can get various levels of combos by getting enough combo points,
                going from 1x to 2x to 3x, etc. Thing is, combos have "health." If you stay in one area for too long or go back to it without
                waiting enough time, then your combo dies. This makes combo running fast paced, constantly searching for new areas to run so your
                combo doesn't die. <br>
                This means you don't really have time to think on what you're supposed to do to clear an area; you have to just jump in and
                wing it. It's a really great test of reaction time, hand-eye coordination, and skill.

                    In particular, fighting games are pretty nice to watch. I like to watch videos on (specific) NetherRealm games: MK11, MKX, Injustice 2,

                Sometimes I want some advice for a few Roblox games, just search up some relatively obscure Roblox celebrity on YouTube and

        <p>Recently, I've gotten into watching commentary videos. Stuff on debate, the intracacies of society, current events, etc.</p> <br>
        <p>For a long time, though, I've really enjoyed watching certain educational channels. Ted-Ed is where I started, and then that turned into
            Kurzgesagt, then MinuteEarth, then It's OK to be Smart, then generally just whatever I can find that's interesting. <br><br>

            I mean, I guess I can talk about specific things... <br><br>
            There are the classics: physical science, or math stuff, stuff that's actually applicable in SOME field, although some are
            more useful than others. Sometimes I watch them with intent to pick up something useful, sometimes I just want to load my brain with
            more trivia stuff. In any case, I watch it. <br> <br> <br><br><br>
            Then there's the theoreticals: this is stuff like Alternate History Hub, some of the Kurzgesagt videos, etc. <br> <br>
